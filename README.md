# ML-covid_timeseries

This is a project done for the 2nd year of Management and Computer Science Bachelor in LUISS GUIDO CARLI for the course Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This objective was to predict covid cases using different model includuing regression and neural network. 
The data used for this was Novel Corona Virus 2019 from Kaggle using the version updated on December 2020

In this repository you can find:
- DataFrame.py which read the csv file and convert it to a dataframe for analysis and extract some basic information
- regression.py which implement linear regression and polynomial regression
- ann_covid.py which implement Long Short term memory (LSTM) neural network
- correration.py which tested different combination of independent and dependent variables.
